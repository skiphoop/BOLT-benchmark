# Benchmark Repository Overview

This repository contains a prototype implementation of BOLT‚Äîa bandwidth-optimized, lightning-fast Oblivious Map‚Äîalong with benchmarking code for performance comparisons. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific experiment or artifact test code. Please refer to the individual folders for more detailed instructions on how to run each benchmark. We have provided readme in each folder.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice on Benchmark Code Reuse

Our benchmarking framework reuses and builds upon the original benchmark or test code provided by the respective projects referenced in this repository. Only minor modifications were made to adapt the experiments to our testing scenarios‚Äîfor example, incorporating YCSB-like workloads, using pre-loaded datasets to reach specific sizes, or aligning with our evaluation metrics. We acknowledge and appreciate the contributions of the original authors.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- **`baseline/`**  
  Contains the CPU baseline experiments referenced in our paper.

- **`engimap/`**  
  Contains experiments based on the artifact [Enigmap repository](https://github.com/odslib/EnigMap) from the Enigmap paper[Paper Link](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity23-tinoco.pdf).
